==============================


a) Prerequisites

-Website provider (or own webserver)
-Installed FSP Pirep (VA) system


b) Installation

This package contains the following files:

-fspsig.php		Main application
-fspsigconfig.php	Config file - Contains the parameters which can be customized
-sig.png		Generic empty background
-sigfsp.png		FsPassengers empty background
-Install.txt		This file
-Config.txt		Configuration parameters
-sigex.jpg		Example of a sig on the generic background
-sigefspx.jpg		Example of a sig on the FsPassengers background
-sigsrex.jpg		Example of a sig on a customized background

Simply place these files in same directory as your "FsPlistflight.php" VA file.


c) Configuration

In order to choose which statistics you want displayed on your dynamic sig, refer to the "Config.txt" file supplied with this package.


d) Usage

You can refer to your dynamic signature using the following URL:

http://yourdomain.com/yourdirectory/fspsig.php 

where "yourdomain.com" is the name of your website provider and "yourdirectory" is the one which contains your "FsPlistflight.php" VA file.

In order to use it as a signature on the FsPassenger forum (and in most other forums for that matter), simply edit your profile and add the following code in the "Signature" field:

[IMG]http://yourdomain.com/yourdirectory/fspsig.php[/IMG]

Do NOT worry about the "php" suffix: your signature will be displayed as a "png" file.
