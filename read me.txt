INTRO
******************************************
Those script remain very basic and simple so it's 
not a pain to tune them to fit your Va need, the 
drawback it that ... they are simple.


******************************************
INSTALL
******************************************

Copying file:
-------------

unzip this archive and copy all the file in your WWW directory
either online or on localhost (using PHPDEV for example)
You can copy them on a subdirectory (example: "vaFsP" or "va")

Take care about the case, many site accept only link with the correct
case: 

ie:  "http://mysite.com/VA/FsPgetflight.php" not egal to 
"http://mysite.com/va/FsPgetflight.php"

creating a SQL DB:
--------------------
If you don't want to use an existing sql base create a DB
with any name as FsP or VaFsP for example.


Creating table managing the settings:
--------------------------------------
Now open your browser and browse to the FsPadmin directory
example: http://localhost/www/FsPadmin/
online example: http://www.mysite.com/FsPVa/FsPadmin/

user:demo
pass:demo

the admin part is self explanatory if you know a bit php/sql
anyway the admin will control your connection and if there
is no required table on your SQL db it will create them for you...

******************************************
FSP UNIT
******************************************
As translating the units is a pain FSP export the 
unit ready with their unit text (ie: "193 kts" "5000 ft")
the admin let you choose wich unit you want that FsP export,
it's a good idea to fix that at start and don't change after
to not mix unit in your database.

The admin let you choose also the welcome message that will 
be displayed to your users in his connect dialog.

******************************************
DEMO DB
******************************************
A demo flight database with some flight is available
in gzip format in FsPadmin folder "flights_db_example.gz"
using PhPMyAdmin you can import it in the flight database
and have some flight already showed on the flight page.


******************************************
EXPORT FROM FSP
******************************************
FsP must have a config file in is "FsPassengers/config_va"
directory, this file will tell FsP where to connect, the username
and password of your Va member as well as the name that will appear
in the "virtual airline" menu of FsP.

So you are responsible to provide this file to any of your members,
the php admin can be tuned to create this file automatically
based on user profile.

See "config_example1.cfg" and "config_example2.cfg"

those config file can be any name but must end with ".cfg"

here an explaination of CFG parameters:
------------------------------------------------
"menu_name="  the name that will appear in the FsP menu
"base_url="   the base url of your site
"path_stats=" the url to the stats page (to view flight) MINUS the base URL WITHOUT slash at start		
path_export=  the url to the get flight script MINUS the base URL WITHOUT slash at start and with the import script name at end.	
"username="   username (you must create this user in admin !!! 3 character minimum!!!)
"password="   user password
------------------------------------------------

******************************************
SEEING EXPORTED STATS
******************************************
A basic script is included FsPListFlight.php, it remain VERY basic
will give only a rough list of the flight in the database so this 
one has to be tuned... A lot can be done, you can display any value
you want and forget the others, mix value to give per pilot or user stats,
overall stats, make query by somes value etc. 

THIS SCRIPT IS INTENDED TO BE INCLUDED IN ANOTHER PAGE not to be viewed
alone, at worse you just need to include header and footer to it...

if you have a site with the index that include other page you probably
just need to do something like that in index.php:

if($display=="va")
{
    include "va/FsPlistFlight.php"
}

another style:

if($display=="va")
{
    include "include/header.php"
    include "include/FsPlistFlight.php"
    include "include/footer.php"
}

or if you want to link directly to the FsPlistFlight.php or your custom script
you'll need probably to include the header and footer.

Look to the FsP demo page here: http://www.fspassengers.com/?action=va
to have a view of what can be done (remain basic but a bit better)


Happy importing !
